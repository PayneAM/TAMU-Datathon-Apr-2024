# The task is to manipulate the data points within the
# dataset strategically to achieve a change in the
# output classification with the least possible impact.
# This is very similar to the Cancer Metamorphosis
# Challenge. Unlike that challenge, you will not be given
# the function that finds the difference between two
# datapoints.
# Dataset Description: The dataset comprises various
# demographic and behavioral attributes such as age,
# gender, education, driving experience, credit score,
# and more. You may use the pre-trained model we
# provide you below to test your data points before
# submitting them.
# Submission Details: The score for the number
# changes you may make must be less than 2. From
# the dataset, the rows that you have to change the
# outcome of are the following IDs: 86162, 848214,
# 984163, 313691, 792189 Each datapoint must be added
# to a csv file in the same order given above before
# submitting. You will also be provided a starter
# notebook which will be included in the google drive link
