# The task is to manipulate the data points within the
# dataset strategically to achieve a change in the
# output classification, but with the least possible
# impact. The dataset comprises various attributes
# that affect if the cancer is malignant or Benign. You
# may use the pre-trained model we provide you
# below to test your data points before submitting
# them. The score for the number changes you may
# make must be less than 4. The evaluation function is
# also provided with the model. From the dataset, the
# rows that you have to change the outcome of are the
# following IDs: 865423, 8915, 898678, 911201, 857010.
# Submission: You must add each of the datapoints in
# the same order given above to a csv file and then
# submit the csv file to get the flag.
