# We have a large database of images of dogs, each
# with bounding boxes drawn around the dogs. Your
# task is to develop a computer vision model that can
# take in an image of a dog and output the (x, y)
# coordinates of the center of the bounding box
# around the dog. The zipped folder contains one
# folder and a csv file. The folder has images of X dogs.
# Each of the file names has a corresponding row in
# the csv file with x_min, x_max, y_min and y_max
# coordinates for the location of the dog in the image.
# Submission Your task is to submit a csv file
# containing the following columns -
# Image name
# X center
# Y center
# Please make sure that your columns are in the same
# order and include header line. The image name must
# contain the extension of the file (Ex.
# “image_16001.jpg”)
