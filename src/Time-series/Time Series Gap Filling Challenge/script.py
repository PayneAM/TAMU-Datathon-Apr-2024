# Overview: Real-world data often comes with its
# challenges, such as poor quality and missing values
# due to various reasons. In time series analysis,
# discarding this incomplete data isn't an option if you
# want to maintain the continuity of your dataset.

# Your Challenge: Your task is to accurately predict
# and fill in the missing values for specified gaps within
# the data. There are five subsets, each missing 90
# days of data, scattered throughout the timeline of
# the original series.

# Dataset: You'll work with the 'train.csv' dataset, which
# contains the "unit" variable recorded daily from 1968
# to 1977. Your challenge is to accurately estimate the
# "unit" values for the missing periods.

# How to Turn It In: Check out
# 'test_submission_example.csv' for how you should
# format your prediction. Use the data in 'test.csv' to
# make your forecast.
